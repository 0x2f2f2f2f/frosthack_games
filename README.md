#Inspiration
Inspired by Baba Is You and tower defence games, we would like to build a strategy game that crosses the two - players can manipulate the rules of the world by pushing word blocks around to defend their bases against enemies.

#What it does
Players need to defend their towers against enemies to win the game, they can change the rules of the game through modifying pushable word blocks
